# Contributing to OceanBase Community

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow of OceanBase community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before submitting code to OceanBase community projects, you should first complete the following prerequisites.

#### Create a GitHub account

Before you get started, you will need to [sign up](http://github.com/signup) for a GitHub user account.

#### Sign the CLA

Before you can contribute to OceanBase, you will need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/oceanbase/oceanbase).

#### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Contribute Flow

The following is the workflow of contributing to OceanBase. It's just a guideline, not rule, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### Take an Issue

We use [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to track tasks and feedback on GitHub, and now we divide issue templates into following types: `Bug Report`, `Documentation Related`, `Enhancement`, `Feature Request` and `Question`. You can choose a type of issue to create after click the `New Issue` button on issues page. 

Before you start development on the project, we recommend you to raise an issue for the modification and discuss with the community. If there is an existing issue you interested in, you can reply to the issue and let the maintainer assign it to you.

##### Help Wanted / Good First Issues

To identify issues that are specifically groomed for new contributors, we use the `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels. You can check that on the issues page.

#### Fork and Develop

Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally, see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for details.

Please reference the development guide in the project repository to set up your environment. 

You can also refer to our [documentation website](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs) for more information.

#### Raise a Pull Request

After pushing your code to your fork repository, you can raise a pull request to OceanBase project repository, see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for details.

There is a pull request template for every repository of OceanBase community, you should fill it properly so others can review your pull request more smoothly.

For the format of pull request title and commit message, we recommend to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). If the pull request resolves an issue, you can use `close #xxx` to link it, see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more details.

If you need to update your pull request, just add new commits to the branch and push it to your fork repository, then the pull request will be updated automatically.

### Communication

We will hold developer meetings regularly, you can subscribe this [thread](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/issues/1368) for update.
