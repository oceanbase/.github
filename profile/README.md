### Hey, this is OceanBase 👋 

![OceanBase Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/master/images/logo.svg)

OceanBase is a distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Ant Group. Based on the [Paxos](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) protocol and its distributed structure, OceanBase provides high availability and linear scalability. OceanBase is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.
