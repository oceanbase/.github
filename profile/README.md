OceanBase is a distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Ant Group. Based on the [Paxos](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) protocol and its distributed structure, OceanBase provides high availability and linear scalability. OceanBase is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.
